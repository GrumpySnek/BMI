# BMI
I created a simple BMI calculator (metric).
Enter your weight (in kg) and height (in m; i.e. 1.8 or 1.4) and click calculate. 
The first line will tell you the BMI rounded down.
The second line will tell you your range. 

# Questions/Bugs
Feel free to open an issue for any issues you notice. I did not optimize for handheld devices.
